Task 2a 
Briefly describe where you see problems when working with this table and how these 
problems could be solved.

Answer
large table ~ 5 mil records => it also has too much info that repeats (a lot of text in the columns) in the same table (split into multiple tables and use fk)

offers_table
id(pk) city_id(fk) camper_id(fk) extra_id(fk) insurance_id(fk) price_eur price_usd

table1
id(pk) city country city_en city_fr

table2
id(pk) camper

table3
id(pk) extra1 extra2 extra3

table4
id(pk) insurance1 insurance2 insurance3

Example ------> Optimize response time for query

All city/country combinations where motorhomes are offered, grouped by the different 
languages.
  select o.id, t1.city , t1.ccountry .... from table1 t1 inner join offers_table o on o.city_id=t1.id


Task 2b 
What would be considered in the choice of data types for each column ?

Answer
- char replaced with varchar (varchar allocates size dynamically - 1byte foreach char + 1byte for size)
- price should be decimal instead because you can specify the number of digits after a decimal point DECIMAL(x,y)-fixed number

Task 2c 
What is meant by an "index" on a table and what should be considered when indexing ? 
What indexes would you set in the given example ?

Answer
- pk is auto indexed (clusterd)
- indexes are used in order to retrive data faster
- in sql the most efficient type of index is int
- fk is auto indexed

example above 
offers_table
id(pk) city_id(fk) camper_id(fk) extra_id(fk) insurance_id(fk) price_eur price_usd
...

Task 2d 
Explain briefly what "foreign keys" are, when they should be used and when they should 
not be used! Would you use foreign keys in the example ? Please give reasons for your 
answer.

Answer
- fk is a constraint (maintain relations between tables)
- you can also set an action type for a fk (on update,delete) ex: cascade ---> if u have a table with user_profiles with pk and one with user_profiles_details with fk --- if u delete the user id 1 then u wanna delete the user profile id with fk 1 . for that u use cascade on delete.
- ex: use fk when u wanna insert a new offer so that u make sure the city_id u give is included in table_1
